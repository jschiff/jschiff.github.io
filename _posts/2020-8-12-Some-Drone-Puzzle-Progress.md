title: Buttons, Doors, and Light Bulbs
---

I just wanted to share some small progress I've made in my as-yet untitled drone-based puzzle game. Here you can see I have a pressure sensitive button that is hooked up to both a door and a lightbulb. The button reacts to either the drone itself or another object which the drone can place on the button. Nothing revolutionary but these are small stepping stones that will serve as the foundation for the game!
                                                                                                    
The button is pretty much my first foray into Unity's Animation system. It took me a bit to even get this basic behavior working correctly.
